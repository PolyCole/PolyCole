### Hello hello 👋🏻
My name is Cole Polyak and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Denver. I graduated in December of 2020 from DU with a BS in Computer Science Magna Cum Laude. Outside of software engineering, I'm an avid outdoorsman, skier, and reader. Additionally, I'm always looking for someone to [play chess](https://lichess.org/@/PolyCole) with 🙃

## 🔭 What I'm Up To
I just recently finished up my distinction project to achieve honors in my BS. I analyzed 10 of the largest web frameworks in industry today, to better understand how each can be properly leveraged to create elegant and well-engineered web solutions. If you'd like to read the write-up of my project, you can do so [here](https://bit.ly/340Ugh9).

In addition to a few passion projects, in my freetime I'm currently involved with a tech startup called PocketChange, which aims at making charitable giving more accessible in a day-to-day setting, utilizing the power of Natural Language Processing and micro-donations. If you'd like to learn more, check them out [here][3]!
